This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.js.  It arises when you have a component that dynamically changes its content.  The issue is that Tailwind's purge functionality, which removes unused styles to optimize the CSS bundle size, might remove classes that are added or removed conditionally.  This causes those elements to not be styled as expected. For example: `<div :class="{'text-red-500': isError}"></div>` where `isError` is a reactive variable that switches between true and false, but only `text-red-500` is purged because at build time, the class may not exist in the initial render causing the other styles to not apply when the condition changes.
